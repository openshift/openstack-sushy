    Adds two new timeout parameters to the ``Sushy`` class constructor to
    allow faster failure when a BMC is unreachable:

    * ``read_timeout``: HTTP read timeout in seconds. This is the maximum
      time to wait for a response from the BMC after the connection is
      established. Defaults to 60 seconds (unchanged from previous behavior).

    * ``connect_timeout``: TCP connection timeout in seconds. This is the
      maximum time to wait for the initial TCP connection to the BMC to be
      established. When specified, sushy uses separate connect and read
      timeouts, allowing faster failure when a BMC is unreachable while
      still allowing longer read timeouts for slow BMCs. If not specified,
      ``read_timeout`` is used for both.

    This change is fully backwards compatible. Setting ``connect_timeout``
    to a lower value (e.g., 10 seconds) significantly reduces the time
    spent waiting when a BMC is unreachable, which previously could take
    up to 60 seconds per connection attempt.
