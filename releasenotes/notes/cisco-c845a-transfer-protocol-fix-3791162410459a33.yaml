    Fixes virtual media insertion on BMCs (such as Cisco C845A M8 with
    Redfish Base.1.18.1) that return ``ActionParameterMissing`` for the
    missing ``TransferProtocolType`` parameter without including a
    ``RelatedProperties`` field in the error response. The
    ``is_transfer_protocol_required`` method now also checks for the
    parameter name in ``MessageArgs`` as a fallback.
