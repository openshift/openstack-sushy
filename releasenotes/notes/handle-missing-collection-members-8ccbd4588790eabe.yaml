    Some Redfish implementations advertise collection members in their JSON
    responses that don't actually exist. For example, the HGX board lists
    LogServices/FDR as a member, but returns 404 when sushy tries to fetch it.
    This causes sushy to fail during System initialization. We now handle
    those gracefully by allowing get_members() to catch ResourceNotFoundError
    for individual members.
